# Artifact Enhancement 2
The artifact I selected was my final project from CS-340, the version I am using for the modification is my improved version from the second enhancement. The original artifact only served to be a proof of concept project in which CRUD operations occurred through curl requests. The intent of this enhancement is to provide a web interface to allow a user to execute CRUD operations for a MongoDB database.

This enhancement showcases my ability to improve existing code and increase the efficiency of the software. In its prior state, the old artifact was cluttered, redundant, and not up to standard python conventions. By breaking the code into multiple pieces and implementing them all into the REST API, I am able to conserve memory, and allow the prevent errors as the code is easier to read. Clear code allows for mistakes to be more easily seen. When in a production environment, software needs to be as efficient as possible as tiny slowdowns can become massive.

I learned a few lessons while enhancing this artifact. The first lesson I learned was removing redundancy and breaking up large code blocks into smaller code blocks makes it a lot easier to read and update existing software. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, and that applies to code as well; if you already have the functionality developed you should reuse it. I faced minimal challenges while enhancing this artifact, however one challenge I did face was attempting to determine the most efficient way to restructure the code. There are infinite ways to design code, finding the one that is the most efficient is difficult.
