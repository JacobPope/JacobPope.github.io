# Artifact Enhancement 3
The artifact I selected was my final project from CS-340, the version I am using for the modification is my improved version from the second enhancement. The original artifact only served to be a proof of concept project in which CRUD operations occurred through curl requests. The intent of this enhancement is to provide a web interface to allow a user to execute CRUD operations for a MongoDB database. I chose this artifact as it showcases my skills in data manipulation and data processing through software. Interfacing with databases is a crucial skill as storing information locally is rarely effective or beneficial, let alone practical.  I learned a great deal while enhancing this artifact, prior to this project, I have had little to no experience with Python, HTML, or JavaScript. I learned a great deal about each when implementing my web interface. Programming Languages handle data differently, and a challenge I confronted was JSON formatting from Python to JavaScript. Understanding how the Bottle RESTFul API handled HTML templates and HTTP requests took researching the included documentation as well as further research. A situation Iâ€™ve struggled with in the past is interconnecting software to provide further functionality to the program, and this enhancement has given me further understanding of how to intertwine different technologies.
